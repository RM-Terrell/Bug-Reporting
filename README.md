# Bug-Reporting

A simple full stack ASP.NET MVC application designed to allow users of a website to submit issues they encounter, and then allow devs to view, track, and resolve them.

Uses jquery, bootstrap, bootbox, and jquery datatables plugin. Data bases are managed using code first migrations.

## Still to be built:
* All submission default status to "not viewed"
* Option in dev view to set status of report to "in progress" and "complete"
* Improved "Details" view of each report
